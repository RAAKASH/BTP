<h2> Information about simulations</h2>
<h3> Radiation</h3>
<h4> Method A - Using simulations</h4>
First checked if radiation played any significant role in simulations because it takes double the time on an i7 4510U processor. This was done by using the below steps.
<ul>
<li> Running simulations with radiation, without radiation.
<li> Compare the temperature profiles for the time of simulation.
</ul>
<h4> Method B - Using correlations</h4>

</ul>

<h4> Results </h4>
It was found out that there werent any significant differences, hence radiation can be safely dropped for simulations.
