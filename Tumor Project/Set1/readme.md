# Working comsol matlab livelink code
The no of simulations are reduced by 2 operations: <br>
1) Ignoring all defects deeper than 30 mm in the y direction.
2) Random dropping of parameters by using a threholding hyperparameter.
<br>
To increase the number of simulation I recommend increasing the depth.
